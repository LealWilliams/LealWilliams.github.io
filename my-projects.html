                        Junkyard Pool is a game I developed during my final year at University
                        along with 6 other team members. It was developed for the PS4, and was
                        built from the ground-up on our custom game engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The premise of the game is two players build their cues out of random
                        junk parts, and then play a game of pool using them. Each part has different
                        stats which influence how they interact with the ball when firing.
                        Power increases the speed and Accuracy lowers the variance that the ball gets
                        hit with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aspects which I worked on in this game include the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collider Classes</li>

                        <li>Physics Calculations</li>

                        <li>Cue Building Menu</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Junkyard Pool was nominated for 5 awards at the Game Republic Student Showcase 2022</p>

                        Rita Roo is a 3D platformer I developed alongside 5 other team members
                        during my second year at Sheffield Hallam University. It was developed
                        using Unity and for PC. The scripts were written in C#.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This game was a standard 3D platformer, developed in just 6 weeks, where you
                        collected gold nuggets and defeated the lava enemies in order to unlock the next area
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked on the following features for this game:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Player Movement Physics</li>
                        <li>Player Attacks</li>
                        <li>Interactable Objects such as Gold Nuggets</li>
                        <li>UI Functionality</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        The trailer below was created by one of the artists on the team.

                        Toucan's Flight is a 2D platformer I developed using DirectXTK as a solo project.
                        The project was inspired by 2D Mario. This was one of my projects during my Second Year of University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this game, you collected Dragon Fruit in order to increase how high/long
                        the Toucan Character can fly. The game was based in levels that are rather open,
                        so the player must explore where they can next reach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this project I developed most of the visual assets.
